### Report bugs with using Github's issues
---------------------------------------------
Use GitHub issues to track public and interesting bugs. Create a new issue and report a bug. It â€™s very easy.

### A typical Bug Report tend to have:
------------------------------------------

* A quick summary and/or background

* Steps to reproduce

  * Be specific 
  
  * Be verbose
  
  * Be careful of pronouns
  
  * Read what you wrote 

  * Make sure that the software is up to date.
  
  * Search github to see whether the bug has been reported or not.

  * Make a sample code easier and  give information detail.


#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is essentially a superficial change, it changes you do not want to add stability of the Rails, function, or what is substantially the testability is not generally accepted.

### Summary 
-------------
* The first purpose of a bug report is to let programmers see the obstacles for themselves. If you can not stay with them in order to fail in front of them, please give them detailed instructions so that they can be made to fail on their own.
* If you think you can, be sure to diagnose the problem yourself. However, if there is a failure, it should also report the symptoms.
* Please be prepared to provide additional information as needed.
* Please write clearly. Say what you are saying and don't get it misunderstood.
