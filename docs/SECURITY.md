## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.
Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is acknowledged or declined, and so on.

## Reporting Sensitive Data 
* Invalidate tokens and passwords.
* Remove the info and clear the GitHub history
* Assess impact of leaked private info.

## Reporting GITHUB APP Issues 

* The application access rights.
* The author/organisation credibility.
* How good is the appâ€™s security posture - a breach of them gives attackers access to your code!
* Write more defensively when you push code/data knowing anyone could see.
* Find it easier and safer if you decide to open source the project.

## Reporting Projects and monitoring
* Required reviews
* Required status checks
* Continuous integration (CI) and testing
* Monitoring and logging
     

## Reporting Security Issues
* We takes security bugs in the toolkit seriously.
* We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Importing Projects 
* Before importing a project into a public GitHub repo, fully audit the history for sensitive data, and remove it before adding to GitHub.
