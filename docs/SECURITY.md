## Dependency insights
- When a security vulnerability is released publicly, enterprises need tools to quickly audit dependencies and better understand their exposure. Dependency insights builds on the power of the dependency graph, so enterprises get full visibility into their dependencies, including details on security vulnerabilities and open source licenses.

## Security policy
- Security is everyone’s job, and well-meaning users often create public issues to let maintainers know about a suspected security bug. Now with support for a security policy, maintainers can reach users as they create new issues to let them know there’s a security policy they should follow. Organizations can also create one security policy for their entire organization that automatically applies to every repository within the organization.

## Importing Projects 
- Before importing a project into a public GitHub repo, fully audit the history for sensitive data, and remove it before adding to GitHub.
